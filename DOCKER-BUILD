## If you use this method, you don't need to use the AWS-BUILD-* documents.
## However, you should update the AMI image from time to time with security updates.

    1  yum update
    2  yum install docker
    3  service docker start
    4  docker login
    5  docker pull mmcgreal/amz-py-foundation-dev
    6  vi ~/.bashrc
    7  set -o vi
    8  docker images
    9  docker run -dp 80:80 edf /home/hrseweb/bin/start-hrse


## TO UPDATE THE IMAGE...
## You'll probably want to do this with a big, fast, AWS image with lots of network bandwidth so that it will go quickly.

    1  (follow steps 1-8 above)
    2  docker run -i -t IMAGEID bash -o vi
    3  yum --enablerepo=epel update
    4  (from another window) docker commit CONTAINERID mmcgreal/amz-py-foundation-dev:hrseserver
    5  exit
    6  docker push mmcgreal/amz-py-foundation-dev:hrseserver
