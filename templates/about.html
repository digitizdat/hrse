              "A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves: an unrecorded, unanalysed thought. And that's a problem because privacy matters.  Privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be." - Edward Snowden

              We are breaking over a cultural threshold.  Our struggle to cope with the growing volume
              of information we produce and collect has been relieved by our ability to project
              ourselves into our machines.  Machine learning is a monumental achievement that enables us
              to extend our conscious minds to higher levels of global awareness without being overwhelmed.  However,
              just as this technology expands us, it also creates new methods of control.

              The Human Random Sequence Experiment is intended to evoke questions about the psychological and
              sociological effects of the integration of these algorithms into our daily lives, and in
              particular, questions about their use in behavior analysis and the dehumanization of people to
              data points.
          </div>
          <div class="t3">
              Our behavior is subjected to analysis by algorithms with accelerating frequency by
              companies like Google, Amazon, Target, Walmart, credit card companies, auto manufacturers,
              and, of course, by our own government, which creates significant imbalances in our relationships
              with these entities.  We are categorized in every conceivable way as our lives and our behavior
              patterns are digitized and archived.  Questions about control, predictability, and free will
              come to mind:  Can we control information about ourselves that is freely and involuntarily projected? 
              What does it mean to be spontaneous?  Can a person really even be spontaneous?
          </div>
          <div class="t3">
              The more information about our behavior is consolidated, the more accurately a set of algorithms
              can make predictions about us.  But it is important to keep in mind that it is <i>we</i> who are analyzing
              us.  We make up the companies, we write the algorithms, we produce the data, and we store the data.  We also
              create new knowledge in our analyses, which generates new data, and onward the cycle continues.

              Let's strip ourselves down to simplest terms: Let's just type 0s and 1s.  OK, we
              can't actually be mathematically random, but can we at least prevent our algorithms
              from recognizing who we are?  What kind of thing comes out of you when you attempt to
              be random?  Is there any part of you there?  If you try to break out of your own behavior,
              what are you?  These questions call to mind Marcel Duchamp's readymades, John Cage's quest for an
              absence of self, and Arman's Robot Portraits, which all seem ever more prescient since our technology
              has now surpassed our paranoid speculation.
          <br/><br/>
              What if we sequenced between people, where each person's nth input is added to the sequence in
              the nth round of selection?  How many people does it take to create mathematical randomness?  By
              crowdsourcing human attempts at random input, I'd like to show that it is through our interactions
              with others - society itself - that we generate the chaos of nature that is life itself.
          <br/><br/>
              A corporation may go to any length to get better intelligence about its customers.  Here we have
              the most evasive, exiguous input we can offer: an actual attempt to not provide something useful.  How do we
              fare against the power of machine-driven pattern recognition?
          <br/><br/>
              The work itself requires participation by an audience.  The more participants provide sequences and accurate
              information for comparison, the interesting the exploration becomes.
          <br/><br/>
              The very act of attempting to be spontaneous or random, repeated over and over,
              person after person, as an allegory for the future: humans attempting to break out of the
              imprisonments of behavior analysis by machines, but in the process they themselves become machine-like.
          <br/><br/>
              Can we find that there is meaning in everything?  Can there be a patternless space if our pattern
              recognition machines are trained sufficiently?  Wouldn't the very act of creating such a space assign it
              meaning?

              This website is part of a project by artist Martin McGreal called Outsourcing Thought, a study of the effects of the
              pervasive integration into society of machine-driven pattern recognition algorithms, and an exploration of the boundary
              between art and technology.  Please send any questions or comments you have about this site or the project to Martin
